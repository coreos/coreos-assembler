# colorjson

Package `colorjson` implements encoding and decoding of JSON as defined in RFC 7159. The mapping between JSON and Go values is described in the documentation for the Marshal and Unmarshal functions. This package is a fork from `golang.org/pkg/encoding/json` with colorized support for printing on terminal.

See "JSON and Go" for an introduction to this package: https://golang.org/doc/articles/json_and_go.html
