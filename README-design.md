This document describes some of the current high level design
of the project.  It assumes some familiarity with the primary `README.md`.

Builds
----

coreos-assembler operates on a "build directory", which can contain multiple
builds.  A build is a pairing of an OSTree commit (stored as `*-ostree.tar`)
as well as an optional set of disk images.

This is in contrast to [rpm-ostree](https://github.com/projectatomic/rpm-ostree/)
which just generates OSTree commits, and doesn't have anything to do with disk images.
Another way to say this is that coreos-assembler ties together OSTree commits
with disk images under a single build schema, and gives them the same version numbering
for example.

The default for `cosa build` is to generate a new OSTree commit and a `qemu` image.
This supports e.g. `cosa run`.

The OSTree commit data is generated via rpm-ostree, using `src/config/manifest.yaml`.
Image configuration uses `src/config/image.yaml`.

Physically, a coreos-assembler build is represented primarily by a new
subdirectory in `builds/$version`, and inside that directory there's a
`meta.json` that contains a lot of relevant metadata, including the OSTree
commit.

There is also a `builds/builds.json` which maintains the list of builds.  The reason
for this is that HTTP doesn't offer a way to enumerate a directory. 

After a build is generated there are a variety of `buildextend-$x` commands, for example
`buildextend-ec2` which can upload to AWS, and `buildextend-metal` which generates
a bare metal disk image.

By default, builds are pruned (as is the OSTree repository), although one can
use `build --no-prune` to prevent this.

For more information on OSTree and build systems, see [the libostree docs](https://ostree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/buildsystem-and-repos/).

Change detection
---

All of the filesystem content of a build goes into the ostree commit. Images are
just wrappers for that, containing the partition layout, etc. rpm-ostree has a
lot of built-in intelligence around change detection; if you run
`coreos-assembler build` and the rpm-md repositories haven't changed, and you
haven't edited the manifest, it will simply not generate a new build.

You can detect this situation in a pipeline by comparing `readlink builds/latest`.

However, coreos-assembler builds on top of rpm-ostree and also generates
disk images.  It uses supermin to run a virtual machine that runs
code to write the ostree content along with the filesystem layout into a
disk image.

If you want to force a build, use `coreos-assembler build --force`.  A common
reason to do this is when something changes in the tooling itself and you
want that change.

Managing data
----

cosa offers `buildprep` which downloads builds from `https://` or `s3://`,
as well as a `buildupload` which is oriented around S3 today.  However,
there are a wide variety of S3-compatible storage systems, so you are
not tied to AWS.
