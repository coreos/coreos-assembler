Fedora CoreOS and Fedora Cloud release utility. Releases are done in two
stages, each with their own command: pre-release and release. Both of these
commands are idempotent.

## plume pre-release

The pre-release command does as much of the release process as possible without making anything public.
This includes uploading images to cloud providers (except those like gce which don't allow us to upload
images without making them public).

## plume release

Publish a new CoreOS/Cloud release. This makes the images uploaded by pre-release public and uploads
images that pre-release could not. It copies the release artifacts to public storage buckets and updates
the directory index.

## plume index

Generate and upload index.html objects to turn a Google Cloud Storage
bucket into a publicly browsable file tree. Useful if you want something
like Apache's directory index for your software download repository.
Plume release handles this as well, so it does not need to be run as part of
the release process.

## Pre-flight

### AWS

Before you can create AMIs you need to ensure you have the following created:

* S3 bucket
* VM Import Service Role
* VM role-policy
* Optional: Allow VM Import Service Role to read KMS for disk encryption

#### Create S3 Bucket

Create a S3 bucket:

`aws s3 mb s3://my-cool-example-plume-bucket --region us-east-2`

Replace `my-cool-example-plume-bucket` with your unique S3 bucket name. Make sure to put in the correct region.

#### Create Import Service Role:

In order for plume to be able to create AMIs, it needs a role and role policy created. You can read more about it in detail [here](
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vm-import/latest/userguide/vmimport-image-import.html#import-vm).

Save this to `vmimport-trust-policy.json`:

```
{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
      {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": { "Service": "vmie.amazonaws.com" },
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
         "Condition": {
            "StringEquals":{
               "sts:Externalid": "vmimport"
            }
         }
      }
   ]
}

```

Use this file to create the new plume role:

`aws iam create-role --role-name plume --assume-role-policy-document "file://vmimport-trust-policy.json"`


Save this to `plume-role-policy.json` and replace `my-cool-example-plume-bucket` with the correct S3 bucket name:

```
{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement":[
      {
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
            "s3:GetBucketLocation",
            "s3:GetObject",
            "s3:ListBucket"
         ],
         "Resource":[
            "arn:aws:s3:::my-cool-example-plume-bucket",
            "arn:aws:s3:::my-cool-example-plume-bucket/*"
         ]
      },
      {
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
            "ec2:ModifySnapshotAttribute",
            "ec2:CopySnapshot",
            "ec2:RegisterImage",
            "ec2:Describe*"
         ],
         "Resource":"*"
      }
   ]
}
```

Assign the plume role policy to the `vmimport` role:

`aws iam put-role-policy --role-name vmimport --policy-name plume --policy-document "file://plume-role-policy.json"`

Optional: Allow the plume role to use KMS to read encrypted S3 buckets.

If you get this error:

> The service role <vmimport> does not exist or does not have sufficient permissions for the service to continue

You might have S3 SSE enabled and you need to add this policy to the `plume` role.

Save this to: `plume-s3-sse-role-policy.json`:

```
{
   "Version":"2012-10-17",
   "Statement":[
      {
         "Effect":"Allow",
         "Action":[
            "kms:Decrypt"
         ],
         "Resource":"*"
      }
   ]
}

```

`aws iam put-role-policy --role-name plume --policy-name plume-s3-sse --policy-document "file://plume-s3-sse-role-policy.json"`


## Testing

### Perform the "release"

```sh
bin/plume pre-release -C user --verify-key ~/keyfile -V $version-$COREOS_BUILD_ID
bin/plume release -C user -V <version>-$COREOS_BUILD_ID
```

### Fedora Cloud Releases

There are two sub-commands to do a Fedora Cloud Release: `pre-release` and `release`. When using `pre-release` plume will download the compose-id from the specified channel, extract the contents, and upload it to S3. From there it will use the import VM feature within AWS to create a private AMI from S3 and it will make it available across all regions. When using `release` it will make these AMIs public.

Here is an example of doing a Fedora Cloud pre-release with plume:

```
./bin/plume pre-release                   \
  --distro fedora                         \
  --channel cloud                         \
  --version 30                            \
  --timestamp 20190819                    \
  --respin 0                              \
  --board x86_64                          \
  --compose-id Fedora-Cloud-30-20190819.0 \
  --image-type Cloud-Base                 \
  --debug
```

Here is an example of doing a Fedora Cloud release with plume:

```
./bin/plume release                       \
  --distro fedora                         \
  --channel cloud                         \
  --version 30                            \
  --timestamp 20190819                    \
  --respin 0                              \
  --board x86_64                          \
  --compose-id Fedora-Cloud-30-20190819.0 \
  --image-type Cloud-Base                 \
  --debug
```

### Clean up

Delete:

- AWS AMIs and snapshots in `us-west-1`, `us-west-2`, and `us-east-2`
