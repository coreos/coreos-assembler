# Building custom immutable container-native operating systems

Creating custom immutable container-native operating systems is now supported
by the [Fedora bootc project](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/bootc/getting-started/),
and Fedora CoreOS derives from that project.

Please see the bootc documentation for guidance on building custom operating systems;
Fedora CoreOS is focused on a "direct consume" model; see also
<https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-coreos/faq/#_how_does_fedora_coreos_relate_to_fedora_bootc>.
