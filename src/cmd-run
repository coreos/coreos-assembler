# This enables "devshell" mode.  Important things to understand:
#
# The default connection is over ssh, but you can use --devshell-console
# to directly connect to the serial console to e.g. debug things in
# the initramfs.
#
# You can exit via either exiting the login session cleanly
# in SSH (ctrl-d/exit in bash), or via `poweroff`.
#
# If 9p is available and this is started from a coreos-assembler
# working directory, the build directory will be mounted readonly
# at /var/mnt/workdir, and the tmp/ directory will be read *write*
# at /var/mnt/workdir-tmp.  This allows you to easily exchange
# data.
